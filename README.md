# italian-fiscal-code-calculator
Italian Fiscal Code Calculator created by me while studying.

I included the same program in 3 versions:
terminal software in c;
windows api software in c++;
html, css, javascript website;
 
Regarding html and javascript, the immagine.jpg mentioned in the code is not included in the repository because it was found on Google images and not created, by me.
You can see how it should look like at https://mistmaycodicefiscale.netlify.app/
